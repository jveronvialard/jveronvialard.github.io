Hi!
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
I'm a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at NVIDIA, specializing in large language models and with a proven track record of building next-generation AI products. My expertise includes memory-efficient and distributed LLM training, reliable and consistent LLM evaluation, and industrial-scale AI solutions. I've contributed to multiple patents and successful product launches. My experience spans the full research-to-deployment cycle, including ideation, product design, development, deployment, and ongoing maintenance, often working with cross-functional teams to drive innovation.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Before joining NVIDIA, I worked for 2.5 years as a Senior Applied Machine Learning Scientist at Splunk (acquired by Cisco in March 2024). During my time there, I trained and deployed large language models for query language code generation and explanation, with a focus on distributed and parameter-efficient training. I contributed to seven patents, delivered technical talks at Splunk .conf22 and NVIDIA GTC 2022, and authored two technical blogs, which can be found here: https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/author/jveronvialard.html.

I hold a Master of Science in Computational Mathematics from Stanford University, where I worked as a part-time graduate research assistant in a biostatistics lab and interned as a computer vision researcher at Guerbet, a pharmaceutical company.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading (novels, sci-fi, essays, manga), skiing (having competed in France), and collecting vintage watches. In early 2024, I launched a personal blog to share my insights on large language models: https://jveronvialard.substack.com/. Feel free to explore it and enter your email for updates!
