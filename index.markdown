Hi there! I am a Senior Applied Machine Learning Scientist at Splunk. I have been working on training and deploying large language models for Splunk's query language code generation and explanation, with a focus on distributed and parameter efficient training, and iterative model performance improvement. I have experience in conducting research from ideation to product deployment and maintenance, and in interacting with cross-functional technical and non-technical teams for prototyping new products. I am also proficient in engaging with customers to enhance their experience.
