Hi there! I'm a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at NVIDIA, working on large language models. I have experience in distributed training and memory efficient fine-tuning of large (10+ billion parameters) language models, and in building and deploying systems around them. Broadly, my experience spans the entire research-to-deployment cycle, including ideation, product deployment, and maintenance, and I am proficient in collaborating with cross-functional technical and non-technical teams for prototyping new products.

Before joining NVIDIA, I worked for 2.5 years as a Senior Applied Machine Learning Scientist at Splunk (acquired by Cisco in March 2024). There, I trained and deployed large language models for Splunk's query language code generation and explanation, with a focus on distributed and parameter efficient training. I also contributed to 4 patents, I gave technical talks at both Splunk .conf22 and NVIDIA GTC March 2022 conferences, and I wrote 2 technical blogs accompanying product releases: https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/author/jveronvialard.html.

Before coming to Splunk, I studied Computational Mathematics at Stanford University. There, I was a part-time graduate research assistant in a biostatistic research lab, and I interned as a computer vision researcher at Guerbet, a pharmaceutical company.

During my free time, I am an avid reader (novels, sci-fi, essays, mangas, etc.), a huge fan of skiing (I participated in a couple competitions a while back in France), and a vintage watch lover. Early 2024, I started my personal blog to share my experience with large language models: https://jveronvialard.substack.com/.
